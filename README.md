# FTTA-Algorithm


Fault-tolerant allocation of deadline-constrained tasks through
 preemptive migration in heterogeneous cloud environments

This is a streamlit application where you can update the tasks and deadlines and our add no.of virtual machines and this application will give you which task is allocated to which particular machine and which virtual machines are busy .
